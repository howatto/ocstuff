# Miscellaneous OC stuff

Random OpenOS libraries that are better off being thrown into a single Git repo. Includes:

- **MT-URI** - URI parsing library, plus a configurable `uri-open` program to handle URIs from the shell. Meant for Minitel RPC but it can be used for anything, really.
- **Mei** - TUI library I accidentally made while working on MDbrowser.
- **MDbrowser** - A pair of libraries, one being a Markdown renderer and the other being a configurable browser that wraps around the first.
